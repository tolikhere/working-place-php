# My notes

### Interfaces:

* Class can have more than one Interface
* Interface can extends multiple Interfaces
* Interface cannot have properties but only constants
* Cannot override a constant of the Interface
* Program by an Interface instead of Implementation

### Polymorphism:
Polymorphism simply means many forms.

An object can be considered polymorphic if it can pass multiple 
instances of checks, which would indicate that it can take many forms.

Polymorphism can be implemented by Interfaces and Abstract classes + Abstract method it will force concrete classes to have the same implementation of methods

But for Polymorphism a good idea to use Interfaces but not Inheritance

## Comparison
* __Abstract Class:__
    * Abstract class can contain method implementations
    * Abstract class can contain properties
    * Abstract class can have private & protected methods
    * Class can only extend a single class

* __Interface:__
    * Interface can only contain method declaration
    * Interface can only contain methods & constants
    * Interface only have public methods
    * Class can implement multiple Interfaces
