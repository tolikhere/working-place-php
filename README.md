# My notes

### Abstract classes:
* Can't instantiate abstract classes __only extend__
* Can contain abstract methods in addition to regular methods & properties
    * Abstract methods know "what" but don't know "how" (only signature)
    * Child classes __must__ implement abstract methods
    * Child method can have a property but only with a default value
    * Visibility of an abstract method can be public or protected

Use abstract classes and methods when you want to force the Child to have basic functionality and implement abstract methods
